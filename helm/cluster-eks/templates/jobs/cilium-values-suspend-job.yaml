# This hook job pauses the Cilium HelmRelease on initial install and also on
# subsequent upgrades. As it has a low hook-weight value it runs before the job
# which actually patches the HelmRelease.
#
# Initial install:
#
# When installing the chart, it takes a few minutes for the endpoint configMap to
# be created so we can wait until after installation to suspend the HelmRelease.
#
# On initial install this job suspends the Cilium HelmRelease to prevent it from
# being installed before the control plane loadbalancer configMap is created as
# Cilium needs to know this in order to start up.
